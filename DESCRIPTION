Description: multiarm provides functions to assist with the design of
    single- and multi-stage multi-arm clinical trials. In both cases the
    available functions allow for sample size determination, trial simulation,
    analytical operating characteristic calculation, and the production of
    several informative plots. An R Shiny graphical user interface is also
    provided to aid design determination. Further details on single-stage design
    can be found in Grayling and Wason (2020) <doi:10.1186/s12885-020-6525-0>.
