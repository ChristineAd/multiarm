Title: Design and analysis of fixed-sample multi-arm clinical trials
Version: 0.9.1
Authors@R: c(person(given = "Michael J.", family = "Grayling",

Description: Provides functionality to assist with the design and analysis of
    fixed-sample multi-arm clinical trials utilising one of several supported
    multiple comparison corrections. Available functions allow for sample size
    determination (including for A-, D-, and E-optimal designs), trial
    simulation, analytical operating characteristic calculation (including the
    conjunctive power, disjunctive power, family-wise error-rate, and false
    discovery rate), and the production of several plots. An R Shiny graphical
    user interface is also provided to ease design determination.
