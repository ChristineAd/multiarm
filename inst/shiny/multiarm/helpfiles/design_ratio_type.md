Allocation ratios
=================

**multiarm** requires values to be specified for the target (stage-wise
amongst the remaining treatment arms, in the case of multi-stage
designs) allocation ratios, *r*<sub>1</sub>, …, *r*<sub>*K*</sub>, of
the number of patients to assign to experimental arms 1, …, *K* relative
to the control arm. For a single-stage design, the options are that they
are equal across all arms, equal across the experimental arms, unequal
across all arms, based on the $\\sqrt{K}$-rule
($r\_1=\\dots,r\_K=1/\\sqrt{K}$), or chosen for *A*-, *D*-, or
*E*-optimality. For a multi-stage design, the options are that they are
equal across all arms, equal across the experimental arms, or based on
the $\\sqrt{K}$-rule ($r\_1=\\dots,r\_K=1/\\sqrt{K}$). Specify your
chosen type of allocation ratios here. Depending on your choice,
suitable input boxes may then appear for you to specify the actual
values of the allocation ratios.
