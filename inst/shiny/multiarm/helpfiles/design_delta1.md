Interesting treatment effect
============================

**multiarm** requires a value to be specified for an interesting
treatment effect, *Î´*<sub>1</sub>, used in the definition of the least
favourable configurations and the global alternative hypothesis, which
are in-turn used to evaluate the power provided by a particular design.
Specify your chosen interesting treatment effect here. It should be
strictly positive.
