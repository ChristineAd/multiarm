# Stopping rule

For a multi-stage group-sequential design, __multiarm__ requires a choice for the type of stopping rule to use.
This can be either simultaneous (stop an entire trial as soon as an efficacy bound is crossed), or separate (continue the trial until a decision is made for all experimental treatments).
Specify your chosen type of stopping rule here.
