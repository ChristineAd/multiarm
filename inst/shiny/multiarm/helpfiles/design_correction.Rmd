# Multiple comparison correction

__multiarm__ requires a multiple comparison procedure (MCC) to be chosen. That
is, it requires a method to use in combination with the chosen significance
level $\alpha$ to determine which null hypotheses to reject. Currently,
__multiarm__ supports a variety of single-step and step-wise MCCs. Specify your
chosen MCC here.
