# Interesting treatment effect

__multiarm__ requires a value to be specified for an interesting treatment effect, $\delta_1$, used in the definition of the least favourable configurations and the global alternative hypothesis, which are in-turn used to evaluate the power provided by a particular design.
Specify your chosen interesting treatment effect here. It should be strictly positive.
