Stage-wise sample size
======================

For a multi-stage design, **multiarm** requires a choice about the total
stage-wise sample size. This can be either fixed (the sample size in
each stage should be a common fixed value, regardless of the number of
treatments present), or variable (the sample size in each stage should
be allowed to vary, according to the number of treatments present).
Specify your chosen type of stage-wise sample size here.
