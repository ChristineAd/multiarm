# Plot treatment effect shift

__multiarm__ can produce a selection of power curve plots. One of these requires
a value, $\delta$, to be specified for a shift in the treatment effects between
the experimental arms. Specify your choice for the treatment effect shift here.
It should be strictly positive.
