Significance level
==================

**multiarm** requires a significance level, *Î±*, to be chosen. That is,
it requires a value to use in combination with the chosen multiple
comparison correction to determine which null hypotheses to reject.
Specify your chosen significance level here. It should be strictly
between 0 and 1.
