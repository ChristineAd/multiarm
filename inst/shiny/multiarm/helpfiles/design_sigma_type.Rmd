# Standard deviations

__multiarm__ requires values to be specified for the standard deviations,
$\sigma_0,\dots,\sigma_K$, of the responses accrued in the control arm and each
of the experimental arms. Here, you can specify your chosen assumption about the
standard deviations: that they are equal across all arms, equal across the
experimental arms, or unequal across all arms. Depending on your choice,
suitable input boxes will then appear for you to specify the actual values of
the standard deviations.
