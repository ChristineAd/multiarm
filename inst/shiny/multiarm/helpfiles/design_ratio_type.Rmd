# Allocation ratios

__multiarm__ requires values to be specified for the target allocation ratios,
$r_1,\dots,r_K$, of the number of patients to assign to experimental arms
$1,\dots,K$, relative to the control arm. Here, you can specify your chosen
type of allocation ratios: that they are equal across all arms, equal across the
experimental arms, unequal across all arms, based on the $\sqrt{K}$-rule
($r_1=\dots,r_K=1/\sqrt{K}$), or chosen for $A$-, $D$-, or $E$-optimality.
Depending on your choice, suitable input boxes may then appear for you to
specify the actual values of the allocation ratios.
