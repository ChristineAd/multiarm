# Significance level

__multiarm__ requires a significance level, $\alpha$, to be chosen. That is, it
requires a value to use in combination with the chosen
multiple comparison correction to determine which null hypotheses to reject.
Specify your chosen significance level here. It should be strictly between 0 and
1.
