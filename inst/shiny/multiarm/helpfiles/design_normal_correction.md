Multiple comparison correction
==============================

**multiarm** requires a multiple comparison correction (MCC) to be
chosen. That is, it requires a method to use in combination with the
chosen significance level *Î±* to determine which null hypotheses to
reject. Currently, **multiarm** supports a variety of single-step and
step-wise MCCs. Specify your chosen MCC here.
