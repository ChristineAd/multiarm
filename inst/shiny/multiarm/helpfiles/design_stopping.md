Stopping rule
=============

For a multi-stage group-sequential design, **multiarm** requires a
choice for the type of stopping rule to use. This can be either
simultaneous (stop an entire trial as soon as an efficacy bound is
crossed), or separate (continue the trial until a decision is made for
all experimental treatments). Specify your chosen type of stopping rule
here.
