Plot treatment effect shift
===========================

**multiarm** can produce a selection of plots (e.g., of power curves).
One of these requires a value, *Î´*, to be specified for a shift in the
treatment effects between the experimental arms. Specify your choice for
the treatment effect shift here. It should be strictly positive.
