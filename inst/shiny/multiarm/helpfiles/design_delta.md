Plot treatment effect shift
===========================

**multiarm** can produce a selection of power curve plots. One of these
requires a value, *Î´*, to be specified for a shift in the treatment
effects between the experimental arms. Specify your choice for the
treatment effect shift here. It should be strictly positive.
