Type of power
=============

**multiarm** requires a choice to be made on the type of power that
should be controlled by the identified design. For a single-stage or
group-sequential design, this can be either conjunctive (power to reject
all null hypotheses), disjunctive (power to reject at least one null
hypothesis), or marginal (the minimum power to reject each of the null
hypotheses). For a drop-the-losers design, it can be either disjunctive
or marginal. Specify your chosen type of power here.
