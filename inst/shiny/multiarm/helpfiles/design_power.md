Type of power
=============

**multiarm** requires a choice to be made on the type of power that
should be controlled by the identified design. This can be either
conjunctive (power to reject all null hypotheses), disjunctive (power to
reject at least one null hypothesis), or marginal (the minimum power to
reject each of the null hypotheses). Specify your chosen type of power
here.
