# Control arm response rate

__multiarm__ requires a value to be specified for the response rate in the
control arm, $\pi_0$, used in the definition of the global null hypothesis,
global alternative hypothesis, and the least favourable configurations, which
are in-turn used to evaluate the operating characteristics provided by a
particular design. Specify your chosen interesting control arm response rate
here. It should be strictly between 0 and 1.
