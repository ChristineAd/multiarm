# Control arm event rate

When assuming the outcomes are Poisson distributed, __multiarm__ requires a value to be specified for the event rate in the control arm, $\lambda_0$, used in the definition of the global null hypothesis, global alternative hypothesis, and the least favourable configurations, which are in-turn used to evaluate the operating characteristics provided by a particular design.
Specify your chosen control arm response rate here.
It should be strictly positive.
