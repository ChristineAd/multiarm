Standard deviations
===================

When assuming the outcomes are normally distributed, **multiarm**
requires values to be specified for the standard deviations,
*σ*<sub>0</sub>, …, *σ*<sub>*K*</sub>, of the responses accrued in the
control arm and each of the experimental arms. For a single-stage
design, the options are that they are equal across all arms, equal
across the experimental arms, or unequal across all arms. Specify your
chosen assumption about the standard deviations here. For a multi-stage
design, the options are that they are equal across all arms or equal
across the experimental arms. Specify your chosen assumption about the
standard deviations here. Depending on your choice, suitable input boxes
will then appear for you to specify the actual values of the standard
deviations.
