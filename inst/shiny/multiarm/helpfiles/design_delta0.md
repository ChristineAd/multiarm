Uninteresting treatment effect
==============================

**multiarm** requires a value to be specified for an uninteresting
treatment effect, *δ*<sub>0</sub>, used in the definition of the least
favourable configurations, which in-turn are used to evaluate the power
provided by a particular design. Specify your chosen interesting
treatment effect here. It should be strictly less than the interesting
treatment effect, *δ*<sub>1</sub>.
