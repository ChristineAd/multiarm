Standard deviations
===================

**multiarm** requires values to be specified for the standard
deviations, *σ*<sub>0</sub>, …, *σ*<sub>*K*</sub>, of the responses
accrued in the control arm and each of the experimental arms.Specify
your chosen assumption about the standard deviations here: that they are
equal across all arms, equal across the experimental arms, or unequal
across all arms. Depending on your choice, suitable input boxes will
then appear for you to specify the actual values of the standard
deviations.
