# Uninteresting treatment effect

__multiarm__ requires a value to be specified for an uninteresting treatment
effect size, referred to as $\delta_0$, used in the definition of the least
favourable configurations, which in-turn are used to evaluate the power provided
by a particular design. Specify your chosen interesting treatment effect here.
