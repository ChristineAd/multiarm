# Uninteresting treatment effect

__multiarm__ requires a value to be specified for an uninteresting treatment effect, $\delta_0$, used in the definition of the least favourable configurations, which in-turn are used to evaluate the power provided by a particular design.
Specify your chosen uninteresting treatment effect here.
It should be strictly less than the interesting treatment effect, $\delta_1$.
