# Type of power

__multiarm__ requires a choice to be made on the type of power that should be
controlled by the identified design. This can be either conjunctive (power to
reject all null hypotheses), disjunctive (power to reject at least one null 
hypothesis), or marginal (the minimum power to reject each of the null
hypotheses). Specify your chosen type of power here.
