# News: multiarm

## Versions 0.10.#

- Corresponding support added for trials with Bernoulli outcomes
(`an_ma_bern()`, `build_ma_bern()`, `des_ma_bern()`, `opchar_ma()`,
`plot.multiarm_des_ma_bern()`, `sim_ma_bern()`).
- `gui_ma()` renamed `gui()` to reflect use for multiple types of outcome.

## Versions 0.9.#

- Package launched with support for the design (`build_ma()`, `des_ma()`,
`des_int_ma()`), assessment (`opchar_ma()`), analysis (`an_ma()`), simulation
(`sim_ma()`), and visualisation (`plot.multiarm_des_ma()`) of fixed-sample
multi-arm clinical trials with a normally distributed primary outcome. An R
Shiny graphical user interface is also provided (`gui_ma()`).
