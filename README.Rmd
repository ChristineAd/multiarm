## Description

`multiarm` provides functions to assist with the design and analysis of
multi-arm clinical trials. Available functions allow for sample size
determination when utilising a variety of multiple comparison corrections
(including for *A*-, *D*-, and *E*-optimal designs), trial simulation,
analytical operating characteristic calculation (including the conjunctive
power, disjunctive power, family-wise error-rate, and false discovery rate), and the production of several plots. An R Shiny graphical user interface is also provided to aid design determination.

## Getting started

You can install the latest development version of multiarm from
[Github](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("mjg211/multiarm")
```

An introductory example of how to make use of the package's core functionality
can be found below. More detailed support is available in the package vignette,
which can be accessed with `vignette("multiarm")`. For further help, please
contact Michael Grayling at michael.grayling@newcastle.ac.uk.

## Details

Currently, functions are provided to support trials in which the primary outcome variable is assumed to be eiher normally or Bernoulli distributed. In total, 14 functions are available. Their naming conventions are such that several character strings are joined together separated by underscores. The first character string indicates the type of calculation the function performs (e.g., design determination, operating characteristic calculations), and the remainder which type of design it is for (normally or Bernoulli distributed outcomes):

- `an_ma()` and `an_ma_bern()`: Analyse summary statistics from fixed-sample
multi-arm clinical trial designs, in order to determine which null hypotheses to
reject.
- `build_ma()` and `build_ma_bern()`: Build multi-arm clinical trial design
objects, like those returned by `des_ma()` and `des_ma_bern()`. For use when a
specific design is of interest.
- `des_int_ma()`: Determines the *A*-, *D*-, and *E*-optimal allocation of a set
of patients in a multi-arm clinical trial with normally distributed outcomes.
- `des_ma()` and `des_ma_bern()`: Determine the sample size required by a
multi-arm clinical trial when one of several multiple comparison corrections is
used.
- `gui()`: Provides a graphical user interface to design determination.
- `opchar_ma()` and `opchar_ma_bern()`: Determine the operating characteristics
(power, family-wise error rates, etc.) of supplied fixed-sample multi-arm
clinical trial designs using multivariate normal integration.
- `plot.multiarm_des_ma()` and `plot.multiarm_des_ma_bern()`: Produce
informative plots (power, false discovery rate curves, etc.) relating to
supplied fixed-sample multi-arm clinical trial designs.
- `sim_ma()` and `sim_ma_bern()`: Empirically estimate the operating
characteristics (power, family-wise error rates, etc.) of supplied fixed-sample
multi-arm clinical trial designs, via simulation.
 
## Example: Normally distributed outcomes

Typically, `des_ma()` would be used first to identify a design for the trial
parameters of interest. For example, consider designing a trial for:

- three experimental treatment arms (see `K`);
- desiring a familywise error-rate of at most 5\%, controlling using Dunnett's
correction (see `alpha` and `correction`);
- desiring marginal power to reject each null hypothesis of 80\% for a
clinically relevant difference of 1 (see `beta`, `delta1`, and `power`);
- assuming the standard deviation of all responses is 1 (see `sigma`);
- allocating patients equally to each arm (see `ratio`).

To compute the implied design, we would run:

```{r}
des <- multiarm::des_ma(K          = 3,
                        alpha      = 0.05,
                        beta       = 0.2,
                        delta1     = 1,
                        sigma      = rep(1, 4),
                        ratio      = rep(1, 3),
                        correction = "dunnett",
                        power      = "marginal")
```

Then, the total required sample size is:

```{r}
des$N
```

In addition, the operating characteristics under the *global null*,
*global alternative*, and each of the *least favourable configurations*, can be
accessed with:

```{r}
des$opchar
```

Useful plots can then be produced with `plot.multiarm_des_ma()` as follows:

```{r dpi = 600}
multiarm:::plot.multiarm_des_ma(des)
```
